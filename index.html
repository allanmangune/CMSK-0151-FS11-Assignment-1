                    Ben Hogan, an American professional golf player, is considered one of the best golf ball strikers of all time. Hogan believed that mastering a golf swing required a lot of practice and repetition. Many believe that Hogan's golf swing is pure and have copied such a swing (n.d., 2006).

                    Hogan's accomplishments include the following:

                <ul>
                    <li>World Golf Hall of Famer</li>
                    <li>Won nine major championships</li>
                    <li>PGA Tour leading money winner</li>
                    <li>PGA player of the year</li>
                    <li>Vardon trophy</li>
                    <li>Associated Press athlete of the year</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Hogan wrote a book titled <span class="five-lesson">Five Lessons: The Modern Fundamentals of Golf</span>. He says golfers should focus more on short games to create a repeatable golf swing. He says that a good golf grip significantly contributes to a golfer's success.

                    Following a successful career in golf, Hogan formed his golf company in 1953 in Fort Worth. After 11 years, he sold his company but kept the chairmanship position.
